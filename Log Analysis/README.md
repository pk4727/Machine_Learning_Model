# VRV_Security's (Log Analysis Assignment)

This repository contains scripts and resources for analyzing server logs to extract meaningful insights such as request counts, most frequently accessed endpoints, and suspicious activity detection.

## Project Structure

- **sample.log**  
    The input file containing server logs for analysis.  
    Each line represents a log entry.

- **VRV_Security’s_Assignment.py**  
    The primary Python script for log analysis.  
    Complete with detailed comments explaining the logic and implementation of each function.

- **VRV_Security’s_Assignment_without_comments.py**  
    A streamlined version of the main Python script without any inline comments.  
    Suitable for environments where minimal file size or simplicity is desired.

- **log_analysis_results.csv**  
    The output file generated by the script, containing the results of the log analysis in CSV format.  
    The file includes:  
    1. Requests per IP address  
    2. The most frequently accessed endpoint  
    3. List of suspicious IPs and their failed login attempts (You can modify the failed login threshold by updating the `FAILED_LOGIN_THRESHOLD` variable in the script.)

## How to Run

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**  
    The scripts require Python 3.x.

2. **Prepare the Log File**  
    Ensure `sample.log` is in the same directory as the Python scripts.

3. **Run the Script**  
    Execute the primary script:  
    ```bash
    python VRV_Security’s_Assignment.py
    ```  
    Or run the version without comments:  
    ```bash
    python VRV_Security’s_Assignment_without_comments.py
    ```

4. **Check the Results**  
    The analysis results will be saved in `log_analysis_results.csv` and also displayed in the terminal.

## Features
1. **Request Counting: Calculates the number of requests made by each IP address.**
2. **Endpoint Analysis: Identifies the most frequently accessed endpoint and its access count.**
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection: Detects IPs with excessive failed login attempts (threshold set at 10 by default).**
